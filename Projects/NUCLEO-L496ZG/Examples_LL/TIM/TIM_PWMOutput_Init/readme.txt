@par Example Description

This example describes how to use a timer peripheral to generate a 
PWM output signal and update PWM duty cycle. This example is based on the 
STM32L4xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization is done 
using LL initialization function to demonstrate LL init usage.

In this example TIM3 input clock (TIM3CLK) frequency is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1),
since APB1 pre-scaler is equal to 1.
    TIM3CLK = PCLK1
    PCLK1 = HCLK
    => TIM3CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock (80 Mhz)

To set the TIM3 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is
calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 80 MHz for STM32L4xx Devices.

Auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 10 ms,
meaning a time base frequency of 100 Hz.
ARR = (TIM3 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM3 counter clock / 100) - 1

Initially, the capture/compare register (CCR3) of the output channel is set to
half the auto-reload value meaning a initial duty cycle of 50%.
Generally speaking this duty cycle is calculated as follows:
Duty cycle = (CCR3 / ARR) * 100

The timer output channel is mapped on the pin PC.07 (connected to LED1 on board
NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins)). Thus LED1 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output
level (active v.s. inactive).

User push-button can be used to change the duty cycle from 0% up to 100% by
steps of 10%. Duty cycle is periodically measured. It can be observed through
the debugger by watching the variable uwMeasuredDutyCycle.

Initially 
- the output channel is configured in output compare toggle mode.
- the dutycycle is set to 0% (so the LED is OFF).

@note The LED is not toggling. When pushing  successively the user button, the 
LED is ON and its luminosity rises as the dutycycle value keeps increasing. When 
the maximum has been reached, the loop restarts from 0% dutycycle.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
