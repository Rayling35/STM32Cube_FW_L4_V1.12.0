@par Example Description 

This example shows how to enter Low-power sleep mode and wake up from this mode using 
an interrupt.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 32 MHz.
This example shows how to enter the system in LP SLEEP mode and wake-up from this
mode using PA.12 (Arduino D2) configured to generate an interrupt on falling edge.
In Low Power mode, system clock is generated by MSI and set to 100 KHz.
 
The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms and in the SysTick 
interrupt handler, LED3 is toggled in order to indicate whether the MCU is in LP SLEEP mode 
or RUN mode.

Firstly, remove jumper between PA.12 (Arduino D2) and GND
and reset the board.
5 seconds after start-up, the system automatically enters LP SLEEP mode and 
LED3 stops toggling.
Put a jumper between PA.12 (Arduino D2) and GND at any time to wake-up the system.
Then remove it.
The software then comes back in RUN mode for 5 sec. before automatically entering LP SLEEP mode again. 

LED3 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED3 toggling : system in RUN mode
 - LED3 off : system in LP SLEEP mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

@note To measure the current consumption, remove jumper JP1 
      and connect an amperemeter to measure IDD current.
      
@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L4xx devices
      
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L432KC RevC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L432KC RevC set-up:
    - LED3 connected to PB.03 pin
    - Use jumper between PA.12 (Arduino D2) and GND when required.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
