@par Application Description 

  This application aims at demonstrating point-to-point communication between two
  B-L475E-IOT01A boards with SubGhz module using Spirit1 driver and STM32Cube firmware. 
 
  How to play the example:
  - Power-up the two nodes (B-L475E-IOT01A boards)
  - The LED LD2 on STM32 B-L475E-IOT01A Discovery board board starts to blink
  - User can press user button (Blue Colour) on any of the STM32 Discovery boards; 
     This causes a command packet to be sent from the node (Node1) to the other 
     node (Node2).
  - The successful communication with the other node will cause the LED LD1 on 
      B-L475E-IOT01A to blink on the receiving node (Node2)
  - The receiving node (Node2) will acknowledge the command by sending an RF 
     packet and this can be seen by blink of LED LD1 on B-L475E-IOT01A of 
     the Node1 
 
  To summarise:
    *1*  User presses User Button on Node1
    *2*  Node1  ----------- RF Command packet ------>   Node2
    *3*    Success = LED LD1 on Node2 Blinks
    *4*  Node1  <---------- Ack packet --------------   Node2             
    *5*    Success = LED LD1 Blinks on Node1

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - Open your preferred toolchain (IAR, Keil, System Workbench for STM32) 
    the project for the required STM32 IoT Discovery board
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the application.
